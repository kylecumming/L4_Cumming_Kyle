<form onsubmit="return false">

The code above was created by adapting the code in stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19454310/stop-form-refreshing-page-on-submit as shown below:

<form name="formname" onsubmit="return false">

- The code in stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19454310/stop-form-refreshing-page-on-submit was implemented by setting the form field onsubmit to "return false"
- Stackoverflows https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19454310/stop-form-refreshing-page-on-submit code was used because when trying to use e.preventDefault with my javascript code it was causing errors that I was unable to fix so I was looking for a different way for the information to stay on the page when pressing the submit button.
- Stackoverflows https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19454310/stop-form-refreshing-page-on-submit code was modified by putting it into my own form button (since the code I used is a condition for a form field and only 3 words it I was unable to modify it more)
